#Augmented Reality Furniture Magazine
###Mixed Reality and Tangible Interfaces project
#####By Petr Devaikin and Matteo Lever

Our project models a new way of exploring and evaluating items found in furniture shop magazines.

Thanks to special markers found in the magazine and an application installed on your smartphone, itâ€™s possible to see and compare virtual representations of the furniture.
